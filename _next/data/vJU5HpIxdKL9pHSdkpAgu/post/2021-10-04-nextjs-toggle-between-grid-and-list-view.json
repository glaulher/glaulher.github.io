'grid' : 'list'}\n  </button>\n</div>\n```\n\n> Add this code above the current wrapping div\n\nThe main things to watch for here are the `onClick` function, which will invoke every time we click this button. This button then calls the `setToggleViewMode` and passes the negative value it currently has.\n\n> Remember using `!` in JavaScript is the logical \"not\" operator.\n\nAnd the next part is based on what the current value is.\nSo if the value is true, we show the grid. Else we show the list.\n\n## Next.js toggle between list and grid view\n\nNow that we have this state and button working, we need to change our main wrapping div.\n\nCurrently it looks like this:\n\n```jsx\n<div className='grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 p-5'>\n```\n\nNote the `grid-cols-3` as this states the content should be split into three columns.\n\nWe want to show three columns if we are in grid mode. Else only one column, which will resemble list mode.\n\nChange your class to look like this:\n\n```jsx\n<div className={`grid grid-cols-${toggleViewMode ? '1' : '3'} gap-4 p-5`}>\n```\n\nThis will use the number we need based on the view mode variable.\nAnd voila, we now have a grid/list mode toggle in Next.js.\n\nYou can find this complete code example on [GitHub](https://github.com/rebelchris/next-tailwind/tree/grid-list-mode).\n\n### Thank you for reading, and let's connect!\n\nThank you for reading my blog.
