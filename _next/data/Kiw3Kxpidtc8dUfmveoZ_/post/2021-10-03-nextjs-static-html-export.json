This gives us an `out` director, which can be uploaded to any server.\n\n![Next.js out directory](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632549979417/h2-1l-ch1.png)\n\n## Hosting the static HTML\n\nSince we now have this static HTML, we can find any hosting provider and upload this `out` directory.\n\nLet's see how this works on [Netlify drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop), for instance.\n\nDrag the `out` directory and wait a couple of seconds and your website is all uploaded!\n\n![Easy Next.js static hosting](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632550173074/8V79gspaI.png)\n\n[View my website hosted via this way on Netlify](https://sleepy-shannon-699868.netlify.app/)\n\n### Thank you for reading, and let's connect!\n\nThank you for reading my blog.
